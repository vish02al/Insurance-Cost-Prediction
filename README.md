# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
## Dataset Description :
In order to make their profit, insurance companies must collect a higher premium than the amount which may become due to the insured person. To achieve this, insurance companies invest a lot of time, effort, and money in creating models that accurately predict healthcare expenses.
## Problem Statement
Prepare the data, identifying and extracting key features (both input and output parameters) relevant to the problem you will solve.
Build and train a machine learning model. Here you can evaluate different algorithms, settings and see which model is best for your scenario.
## Aim 
Create a machine learning model to predict the insurance price charged to the customer. The charge depends on various features such as age, type of coverage, amount of coverage needed, gender, body mass index (BMI), region, and other special factors like smoking to determine what health risks the person possesses.
